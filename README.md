# Log Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides a Python-based solution to analyze web server log files and extract valuable insights. The script processes log files and generates the following:
1. A count of requests per IP address.
2. The most accessed endpoint in the logs.
3. Detection of suspicious activity, such as multiple 4xx/5xx errors from the same IP address.

The analysis results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a CSV file for further review.


### Output
- Terminal Output: The analysis results will be printed in the terminal.
- CSV Output: The results will also be saved in a file named `log_analysis_results.csv` in the same directory.
